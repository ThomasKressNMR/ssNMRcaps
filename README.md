## 3D Printing
Caps are printed in a Formlabs 3 3d printer, using coloured resin (Yellow) in 25 µm resolution.

Supports (touchpoint 0.3mm) were placed manually as follows:

After printing, caps are washed in a FormWash for 10 minutes, then cured for 60 min at 60ºC.

The rough edges of the supports are sanded down by hands after the caps are detached from their support.

## Specs:
### Spinning
-	4mm caps, tested up to 12.5kHz
-	3.2mm caps, thin wall 2.6mm ID or thick wall 2.2mm ID, tested up to 18kHz
-	2.5mm top and bottom caps, (thick or thin wall), tested up to 25kHz
-	1.3mm, top and bottom, tested up to 50kHz

### Background signal:
-	No background detected for 4 mm caps (<sup>1</sup>H zg, and <sup>13</sup>C CP)
-	As the material is based on polyurethane, the caps might induce 1H, 13C background signal.
-	<sup>1</sup>H zg spectrum of the source material (400 MHz / 9.4 T, 5kHZ MAS):

-	<sup>13</sup>C CP spectrum of the source material (400 MHz / 9.4 T, 5kHZ MAS):
